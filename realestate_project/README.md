## Project Overview

This project simplifies the real estate search process by providing users with easy-to-use filters and predictive insights into property value and investment potential. It integrates external data sources to offer up-to-date property listings and relevant market information.

### Objectives:

-   Enable efficient search for real estate properties.
-   Provide filters for specific attributes such as price, year built, and lot size.
-   Integrate AI/ML models to predict property equity and future value.
-   Ensure real-time data updates from external APIs like Zillow.

## Features

-   **Property Search**: Search and filter properties by various attributes.
-   **AI/ML Integration**: Predict potential equity and future property value.
-   **Responsive UI**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Real-Time Data**: Fetch property listings from external APIs (e.g., Zillow).
-   **Custom Filters**: Use keywords, year built, lot size, and more.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React.js
-   **Backend**: Django REST Framework (DRF)
-   **Database**: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL/MySQL (for production)
-   **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
-   **External APIs**: Zillow API, Amadeus API (for destination/flight data)
-   **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Python 3.9+**
-   **Node.js 14+** and **npm**
-   **PostgreSQL/MySQL** (for production databases)
-   **Git** (for version control)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-project.git
cd real-estate-project
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

For Python dependencies, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Backend Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Step 5: Database Setup

Apply migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Run the Application

Start both the Django backend and React frontend:

```bash
# Start the backend
python manage.py runserver

# In a separate terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

You can now access the app at **http://localhost:3000** for the frontend and **http://localhost:8000** for the backend API.

## Usage

-   **Search Properties**: Enter keywords, set filters (price, year, etc.), and get real-time listings.
-   **View Property Details**: Click on a property to see detailed information and AI-based predictions for potential future value.
-   **Apply Filters**: Use advanced search filters like lot size, year built, and more.

## AI/ML Integration

The project integrates AI/ML models to predict property equity and provide investment insights. The models are built using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**, and are trained with historical real estate data.

### Current Capabilities:

-   **Equity Prediction**: Estimate the potential value increase of properties.
-   **Investment Insights**: Analyze trends and provide investment recommendations.

## API Documentation

The application uses external APIs like **Zillow** and **Amadeus** for data fetching. Here’s how the API endpoints are structured:

### Example Endpoints:

-   **GET /api/properties/**: Fetch a list of properties based on filters.
-   **GET /api/properties/{id}/**: Fetch detailed information about a specific property.
-   **POST /api/properties/search/**: Submit custom search queries with filters.

To explore the API, you can use tools like **Postman** or simply visit the API URLs in your browser.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture separating the frontend, backend, and AI components.
